## üß≠ Overview

Unlike traditional cheats, the Trainer uses a **non-invasive overlay injection** method ‚Äî meaning no core file modification or risk of data corruption. All modules operate externally, reading live data from the game‚Äôs render layer to provide **real-time stat visualization**, **AI awareness**, and **tunable combat parameters**.

It‚Äôs the perfect companion for players who want control without compromise.
